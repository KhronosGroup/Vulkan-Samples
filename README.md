## Introduction

The Vulkan Samples is collection of resources to help you develop optimized Vulkan applications.

If you are new to Vulkan the [API samples](samples/api) are the right place to start.
Additionally you may find the following links useful:
 - [Vulkan Guide](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Guide)
 - [Get Started in Vulkan](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)

 [Performance samples](samples/performance) show the recommended best practice together with real-time profiling information.
 They are more advanced but also contain a detailed [tutorial](#tutorials) with more in-detail explanations.

### Goals
- Create a collection of resources that demonstrate best-practice recommendations in Vulkan
- Create tutorials that explain the implementation of best-practices and include performance analysis guides
- Create a framework that can be used as reference material and also as a sandbox for advanced experimentation with Vulkan

## Setup

Clone the repo with submodules using the following command:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples.git
cd Vulkan-Samples
```

Follow build instructions for your platform below.

## Build

### Supported Platforms
- Windows - [Build Guide](./docs/build.md#windows "Windows Build Guide")
- Linux - [Build Guide](./docs/build.md#linux "Linux Build Guide")
- macOS - [Build Guide](./docs/build.md#macos "macOS Build Guide")
- Android - [Build Guide](./docs/build.md#android "Android Build Guide")

## Usage

The following shows some example command line usage on how to configure and run the Vulkan Samples.

```
# Run Swapchain Images sample
vulkan_samples swapchain_images

# Run AFBC sample in benchmark mode for 5000 frames
vulkan_samples --sample afbc --benchmark 5000

# Run bonza test offscreen
vulkan_samples --test bonza --hide

# Run all the performance samples
vulkan_samples --batch performance

# Run Swapchain Images sample on an Android device
adb shell am start-activity -n com.khronos.vulkan_samples/com.khronos.vulkan_samples.SampleLauncherActivity -e sample swapchain_images
```
