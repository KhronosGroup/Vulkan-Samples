 * @brief A pool of buffer blocks for a specific usage.
 * It may contain inactive blocks that can be recycled.
 *
 * BufferPool is a linear allocator for buffer chunks, it gives you a view of the size you want.
 * A BufferBlock is the corresponding VkBuffer and you can get smaller offsets inside it.
 * Since a shader cannot specify dynamic UBOs, it has to be done from the code
 * (set_resource_dynamic).
 *
 * When a new frame starts, buffer blocks are returned: the offset is reset and contents are
 * overwritten. The minimum allocation size is 256 kb, if you ask for more you get a dedicated
 * buffer allocation.
 *
 * We re-use descriptor sets: we only need one for the corresponding buffer infos (and we only
 * have one VkBuffer per BufferBlock), then it is bound and we use dynamic offsets.
