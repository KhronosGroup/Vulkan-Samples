/**
 * @brief MSAA Sample
 *
 * This sample shows the benefits of multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) and how to
 * resolve the multisampled attachments with minimum impact on performance.
 *
 * The UI controls allow the user to choose between different levels of MSAA
 * and to select whether or not to resolve the color and depth attachments
 * within the render pass.
 *
 * Resolving within the renderpass is very efficient on mobile since usually
 * tilers can resolve the multisampled attachments on writeback to
 * main memory. This means on mobile it is possible to get considerable
 * quality improvements with relatively little cost.
 *
 * The alternative to resolving within the renderpass is to have a separate
 * color resolve pass (using vkCmdResolveImage), which is much less efficient.
 *
 * Resolving on writeback was only possible with color attachments, but
 * VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve (promoted in Vulkan 1.2) makes it possible to
 * also resolve the depth attachment within the renderpass.
 *
 * Without this extension there is no simple alternative to resolve depth
 * in a separate pass (vkCmdResolveImage does not support depth).
 *
 * Usually the depth attachment is transient (it is not needed outside the
 * render pass) but some postprocessing effects require it as an input texture.
 * Without the extension, if MSAA is enabled in the geometry pass, the
 * multisampled depth attachment would be have to be written out to be
 * consumed by the postprocessing renderpass.
 *
 * As with unresolved color, writing out unresolved depth attachments is very
 * bandwith intensive and therefore depth-based postprocessing was
 * usually avoided on mobile platforms.
 *
 * This sample shows how to use the extension to also resolve the depth
 * attachment on writeback and use it in a simple postprocessing pass.
