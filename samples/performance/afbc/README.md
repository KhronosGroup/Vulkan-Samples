### AFBC<br/>
AFBC (Arm Frame Buffer Compression) is a real-time lossless compression algorithm found in Arm Mali GPUs, designed to tackle the ever-growing demand for higher resolution graphics. This format is applied to the framebuffers that are to be written to the GPU. This technology can offer bandwidth reductions of [up to 50%](https://developer.arm.com/technologies/graphics-technologies/arm-frame-buffer-compression).
