### Render passes<br/>
Vulkan render-passes use attachments to describe input and output render targets. This sample shows how loading and storing attachments might affect performance on mobile. During the creation of a render-pass, you can specify various color attachments and a depth-stencil attachment. Each of those is described by a [`VkAttachmentDescription`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkAttachmentDescription.html) struct, which contains attributes to specify the [load operation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkAttachmentLoadOp.html) (`loadOp`) and the [store operation](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkAttachmentStoreOp.html) (`storeOp`). This sample lets you choose between different combinations of these operations at runtime.
