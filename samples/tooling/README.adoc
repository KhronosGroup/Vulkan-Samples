ifndef::tooling_samplespath[:tooling_samplespath:]

== Tooling Samples

The goal of these samples is to demonstrate usage of tooling functions and libraries that are not directly part of the api.

=== xref:./{tooling_samplespath}profiles/README.adoc[Profiles Library]

Use the https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles[Vulkan Profiles library] to simplify instance and device setup.
The library defines a common baseline of features, extensions, etc.
