== Overview

This sample implements an order-independent transparency (OIT) algorithm using depth peeling.
It renders a single torus whose opacity can be controller via the UI.
It produces pixel-perfect results.
It is based on the https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/gamedev/docs/OrderIndependentTransparency.pdf[original paper] from Cass Everitt.

== Algorithm

The OIT algorithm consists of several _gather_ passes followed by one _combine_ pass.

Each _gather_ pass renders one layer of transparent geometry.
The first pass renders the first layer, the second pass the second layer, etc.
The N^th^ layer consists of all the N^th^ fragments of each pixel when the fragments are ordered from front to back.

The _combine_ pass is a screen-space operation.
It merges the layer images from back to front to produce the final result.

The algorithm can produce pixel-perfect results, even with intersecting geometry.
When there are more geometry layers than gather passes, the backmost layers get skipped, but the visual results stay stable (i.e. no flickering pixels).

== Options

[cols="2,4,4"]
|===
| Option | Description | Comments

| Camera auto-rotation
| Enable the automatic rotation of the camera
| 

| Background grayscale
| Specify the grayscale value by which the background color is multiplied (0.0 to 1.0)
| 

| Object alpha
| Specify the opacity of the transparent object (0.0 to 1.0)
| 

| Front layer index
| The first layer to be rendered (0 to 7).
| 

| Back layer index
| The last layer to be rendered (0 to 7).
| This cannot be less that the front layer index.

== Tests

This sample was tested on Windows.
The validation layers were enabled and all reported issues were fixed.
The system featured an AMD GPU.
