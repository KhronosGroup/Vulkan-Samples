=== Order-independent transparency using per-pixel ordered linked lists

ifdef::site-gen-antora[]
TIP: The source for this sample can be found in the https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/tree/main/samples/api/oit_linked_lists[Khronos Vulkan samples github repository].
endif::[]

Order-independent transparency algorithm that uses two passes to render transparent geometry.
The first pass gathers fragments into per-pixel linked lists.
The second pass sorts the fragments in each linked lists and blends them into the color attachment.
