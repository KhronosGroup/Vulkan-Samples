== API samples

The goal of these samples is to demonstrate how to use a given Vulkan feature at the API level with as little abstraction as possible.

=== xref:./{api_samplespath}compute_nbody/README.adoc[Compute shader N-Body simulation]

Compute shader example that uses two passes and shared compute shader memory for simulating a N-Body particle system.

=== xref:./{api_samplespath}dynamic_uniform_buffers/README.adoc[Dynamic Uniform buffers]

Dynamic uniform buffers are used for rendering multiple objects with separate matrices stored in a single uniform buffer object, that are addressed dynamically.

=== xref:./{api_samplespath}hdr/README.adoc[High dynamic range]

Implements a high dynamic range rendering pipeline using 16/32 bit floating point precision for all calculations.

=== xref:./{api_samplespath}hello_triangle/README.adoc[Hello Triangle]

A self-contained (minimal use of framework) sample that illustrates the rendering of a triangle.

=== xref:./{api_samplespath}hpp_compute_nbody/README.adoc[HPP Compute shader N-Body simulation]

A transcoded version of the API sample <<compute_nbody,Compute N-Body>> that illustrates the usage of the C{pp} bindings of Vulkan provided by vulkan.hpp.
