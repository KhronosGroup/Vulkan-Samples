= Complex Sample Game Engine

We start out with the engine created in the Vulkan Game Engine Tutorial.  Here, we are showing samples of how Vulkan can be used for selected topics in game engines.  Here is a list of the features implemented in this engine beyond what exists in the Vulkan Game Engine Tutorial:

* Culling
* Mipmaps
* LOD
* Forward+ rendering
* Robustness2
* Shader Tile Image
* Synchronization 2 Frame Synchronization
* Using barriers and timeline semaphores with Transfer Queue for Texture streaming in loading.
* Reflections
* Animated GLTFs

Please find a comprehensive tutorial about each subject that is introduced in the Tutorial directory along with how to use it in your own projects.  We may add new features to the engine as a sample of how Vulkan features can be used; doing so will happen here in the Samples repository.
