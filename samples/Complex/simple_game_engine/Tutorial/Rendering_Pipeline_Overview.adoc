= Rendering Pipeline Overview (this sample)

This engine uses Vulkan Dynamic Rendering with a small, readable sequence of passes. The order is deliberate: it keeps tone mapping explicit, keeps transparency sane, and makes it easy to plug in optional features like planar reflections or the Ray Query compute path.

== The pass order

1. Optional reflection pass (off‑screen):
   * Mirror the camera across a plane (e.g., floors or windows).
   * Render opaque geometry into a reflection render target (color + depth).
   * Transition the reflection image to `SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` for the next frame.

2. Opaque to off‑screen color:
   * Render all opaque objects into an off‑screen color image (`opaqueSceneColor`).
   * Depth is read/write as usual (or read‑only if you ran a depth pre‑pass).

3. Composite to swapchain:
   * End the opaque rendering.
   * Transition `opaqueSceneColor` to `SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`.
   * Begin a new rendering instance targeting the swapchain image and draw a full‑screen pass that samples the off‑screen color (tone mapping included).

4. Transparent on top:
   * Keep the swapchain image as the color attachment and bind the scene depth.
   * Render transparent objects (glass/liquids) back‑to‑front.
   * Glass samples the prior frame’s reflection texture when enabled.

5. UI:
   * Render the UI on top.
   * Transition the swapchain image to `PRESENT_SRC_KHR` after ending rendering.

== Where to look in the code

* Main render loop + pass ordering:
** `renderer_rendering.cpp`
* Pipeline setup (dynamic rendering attachments, layouts, formats):
** `renderer_pipelines.cpp`
* Composite pass shader (tone mapping + presentation):
** `shaders/composite.slang`
* PBR shading utilities shared by multiple pipelines:
** `shaders/pbr.slang`
** `shaders/pbr_utils.slang`
** `shaders/lighting_utils.slang`

== Why this shape

* A single off‑screen buffer makes tone mapping explicit and avoids gamma‑incorrect copy paths.
* Transparent ordering stays simple because the swapchain is the current color attachment in that pass.
* The reflection pass is optional and self‑contained.

== Future work ideas

If you want to take this pipeline further:

* Add a depth pre-pass for heavy scenes (helps early-z and enables more accurate Forward+ clustering).
* Add a lightweight bloom chain that runs between the off-screen opaque pass and the composite.
* Add a dedicated transparent resolve path (weighted blended OIT) if you need lots of overlapping glass.
* Demonstrate hybrid rendering by calling ray queries from a raster shader (reflection probe, shadow test, or glass-only reflections).
