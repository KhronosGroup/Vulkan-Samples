= VK_EXT_shader_tile_image — fast access to tile data

Some GPUs expose “tile” or “subpass” data paths that let shaders read from on‑chip color/depth without a round trip to memory. `VK_EXT_shader_tile_image` is a portable way to tap into that.

In this sample we treat it as an optional optimization: the pipeline remains correct without it, and we only take a “fast path” when the device advertises support.

== What problem it solves

Post‑lighting texture reads from the just‑written color can be expensive. With tile image access, certain patterns become cheaper and more deterministic on supported hardware.

== How we handle it in this sample

* We enable the feature if present and expose a boolean you can check in code.
* The renderer still uses clean Synchronization 2 barriers and ends dynamic rendering before formal layout transitions. That keeps the code understandable on devices that don’t support tile reads.

== Guidance

Use it as an optimization. Write code that’s correct everywhere, then add tile‑image fast paths when available.

== Where to look in the code

* Feature detection and enablement:
** `renderer_core.cpp`
* Dynamic rendering setup and attachment transitions (kept explicit for clarity):
** `renderer_rendering.cpp`
** `renderer_pipelines.cpp`

== Future work ideas

If you want to demonstrate tile-image usage more directly:

* Add a small “local read” post effect that reads from the current color attachment and compares with a regular sampled path.
* Add a device capability print (development-only) so students can see when the fast path is active.
* Add a micro-benchmark scene and compare bandwidth on tile-based GPUs.
