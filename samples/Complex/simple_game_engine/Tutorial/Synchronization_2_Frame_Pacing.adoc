= Synchronization 2 and frame pacing in this engine

Vulkan Synchronization 2 makes barriers and submissions easier to read. This sample uses it to keep uploads and rendering in step without stalls.

The goal here isn’t “maximum cleverness.” It’s predictable ordering:

* the transfer queue moves data onto the GPU
* the graphics queue draws using whatever is ready
* the CPU only mutates per-frame resources when it knows the GPU is done with them

== The moving parts

* Timeline semaphore on the transfer queue — batches of texture uploads signal increasing values.
* Graphics submit waits on the latest uploads value — by the time we draw, textures are ready to sample.
* Frame fences — each frame‑in‑flight has a fence we wait on at the start of the next frame’s CPU work.

== Barriers we rely on

Uploads path:

* `UNDEFINED → TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL` (dstStage: TRANSFER, dstAccess: TRANSFER_WRITE)
* After copy: `TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL → SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` (srcStage: TRANSFER, dstStage: FRAGMENT_SHADER)

Render path:

* Attachment images transition outside active dynamic rendering blocks using `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2`.
* Swapchain transitions: to `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` before composite/transparent, to `PRESENT_SRC_KHR` after ending the last rendering pass.

== Descriptor updates at the safe point

At the start of a frame, after waiting on the frame fence, we refresh only this frame’s descriptor sets. That avoids “update‑after‑bind” pitfalls and frame‑to‑frame flicker during streaming.

== Takeaways

* Keep transitions outside active `beginRendering`/`endRendering` scopes.
* Use clear stage/access pairs; prefer Synchronization 2 for readability.
* Pair timeline semaphores with fences: timelines coordinate queues; fences bound the CPU turn.

== Where to look in the code

* Upload submission and timeline semaphore signaling:
** `renderer_resources.cpp`
** `renderer_utils.cpp`
* Graphics submit waits (including “latest upload value”):
** `renderer_rendering.cpp`
* Image barriers for the render path (attachments + swapchain):
** `renderer_rendering.cpp`
* Swapchain and present integration:
** `swap_chain.h`
** `renderer_rendering.cpp`

== Future work ideas

If you want to experiment with pacing and latency:

* Add a UI toggle for the frames-in-flight count and measure input latency vs throughput.
* Add a “fixed camera path” mode (development-only) to produce repeatable GPU timing comparisons.
* Add GPU timestamp queries around the big passes to visualize where time goes.
* Add async compute experiments (if your device supports it) for things like Forward+ light list building.
