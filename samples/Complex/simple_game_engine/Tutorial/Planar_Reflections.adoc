= Planar Reflections in Our Engine

You’ve probably noticed shiny floors and windows in real‑world scenes. In games, we often fake that look. In this engine we chose a practical, reliable technique: planar reflections. This page explains what they are, why we use them, how they’re implemented, and when you might want something else.

== What are planar reflections?

Planar reflections render a mirror image of the scene across a single plane (e.g., a flat floor or a window). Think of it as a “mirror camera” that looks into the scene from the other side of the reflective surface. We render that mirrored view into a texture, then sample that texture when drawing glass (or any reflective planar surface).

Planar reflections work great for:

* Flat mirrors, calm water, polished floors, glass panes.
* Scenes where you need stable, high‑quality reflections without heavy noise or temporal instability.

They are not ideal for:

* Curved/rough surfaces that need glossy, view‑dependent blurs everywhere.
* Arbitrary reflection directions (e.g., metals with complex micro‑geometry).

== Why we chose planar reflections for the sample

We want a reflection method that is:

* Easy to understand (one extra pass, one extra texture).
* Deterministic and stable (no “sparkles” or temporal accumulation headaches).
* Practical for a single dominant reflector (glass, floor) in a forward renderer.

Planar reflections deliver all three. They also scale well across GPUs without requiring ray tracing hardware.

== How it works in our engine

We add one small pass and one small blend in the main pass:

1. Mirror pass (off‑screen)
** Compute a mirrored view matrix by reflecting the camera across a plane (e.g., Y=0 for a ground plane).
** Render the opaque scene with face culling disabled (or adjusted) into a reflection color+depth target.
** Synchronize the reflection image for sampling in the next pass.

2. Main pass (normal camera)
** Draw opaque + transparent objects as usual.
** When drawing glass, sample the reflection texture and blend it with glass shading using Fresnel + roughness + a user‑controlled “reflection intensity”.

That’s it. No special render graph magic, no ray queries, no temporal accumulation.

== Where to look in the code

* Mirror camera math, reflection pass, and pass ordering:
** `renderer_rendering.cpp`
* Reflection render targets and pipeline setup:
** `renderer_pipelines.cpp`
* Reflection sampling + glass shading:
** `shaders/pbr.slang`
** `shaders/pbr_utils.slang`
* Reflection binding and per-frame safe-point updates:
** `renderer_rendering.cpp` (reflection descriptor refresh)

== The mirror math (short and sweet)

You define a plane in world space: `ax + by + cz + d = 0`.

From that plane you build a reflection matrix `R`. Apply `R` to the regular camera view to get the mirrored view. In practice you’ll also flip culling or set `cullMode = none` for the mirrored pass because the winding order changes under reflection.

We also pass the plane to shaders for optional clipping:

* A simple dot(product) with world position lets us discard fragments “behind” the plane in the mirror pass.

== The rendering steps in detail

Mirror pass:

* Create a reflection color image (format matches your main pass needs; we pick a color format that the composite/glass pass can sample easily) and a reflection depth image.
* Before rendering: transition the reflection color image from `SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` to `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` using Synchronization 2 (`vkCmdPipelineBarrier2`). Do the same for depth to `DEPTH_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`.
* Begin dynamic rendering, bind the PBR pipeline for opaque objects, and disable culling (or flip front faces).
* Render opaque meshes. You can add a clip test against the plane if needed.
* End rendering. Transition the reflection color image to `SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` for sampling in the main pass.

Main pass:

* Render opaque as usual (we use an off‑screen buffer to do tone‑mapped composite later).
* Transparent pass: when drawing glass, sample the reflection texture and blend:
** Use Fresnel (stronger at grazing angles) and reduce with roughness.
** Multiply by a small “reflection intensity” you can tune in the UI.

== Synchronization and barriers (what matters)

We keep it simple with Vulkan Synchronization 2:

* Do not change image layouts inside an active dynamic render pass. End it first.
* Use `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` with: correct source/destination stage masks, access masks, and old/new layouts.
* Reflection color: `SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL → COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` before mirror pass; back to `SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` after.
* Swapchain image: transition to `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` for composite/transparent; transition to `PRESENT_SRC_KHR` only after ending the last rendering pass.

== Descriptors: where is the reflection bound?

* We reserve binding 10 in the PBR set for the reflection sampler.
* At the per‑frame “safe point” (when previous frame’s work is done), we refresh binding 10 for the current frame to point to the reflection image from the previous frame.
* The glass shader checks a UBO flag (`reflectionEnabled`) and samples only when a valid reflection image exists.

== Glass blending: an approachable model

Glass is mostly transmission, but we want vivid, plausible reflections. We use:

* Fresnel term (Schlick): stronger reflections at grazing angles.
* Roughness factor: more roughness → weaker, blurrier reflections (we keep it simple here and just dim the strength).
* Reflection intensity slider: exposed in the UI so you can tune visibility in seconds.

This is not a full physical spectral model, and that’s fine. It’s readable and produces convincing results.

== Alternatives and when to choose them

Screen‑space reflections (SSR)::
* Works without extra passes; uses existing color/depth from your frame.
* Great for puddles and local effects, but can miss off‑screen objects and suffers from temporal instability.
* Choose SSR if you want quick reflections everywhere and can accept occasional artifacts.

Environment maps / cube maps / reflection probes::
* Very fast; precomputed.
* Not view‑accurate for nearby objects; best for distant glossy reflections.
* Choose probes for general ambient reflections or when the surface isn’t a perfect mirror.

Ray tracing (hardware) / hybrid approaches::
* Very accurate; supports complex reflections.
* Requires hardware and advanced denoising; more code and performance cost.
* Choose RT if you target high‑end GPUs and want “it just looks right” reflections everywhere.

Planar reflections (this sample)::
* A single extra pass, deterministic and stable.
* Perfect for one or a few large planar reflectors (floor, windows, calm water).
* Choose this when you want high‑quality mirrors for specific surfaces without adopting ray tracing.

== Performance tips

* Render the mirror pass at a lower resolution (we provide a resolution scale slider).
* Cull aggressively (our CPU frustum culling works for both camera and mirrored camera).
* Disable the mirror pass when the reflective surface isn’t visible.
* Consider blurring the reflection sample for rough surfaces if you want softer looks.

== Troubleshooting

“Reflections appear too weak”::
* Increase the Reflection intensity slider and/or reduce roughness.

== Future work ideas

If you want to push planar reflections further:

* Add a roughness-aware blur of the reflection texture (mip chain or separable blur).
* Add multiple reflection planes (useful for multi-floor scenes).
* Add a screen-space fallback (SSR) and blend with planar where valid.
* Add selective ray query reflections for non-planar surfaces (hybrid approach).

Enjoy experimenting. This approach is intentionally straightforward so you can focus on learning Vulkan’s moving parts without getting lost in a maze of techniques.
