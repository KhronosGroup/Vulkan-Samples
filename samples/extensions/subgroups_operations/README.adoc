# Subgroups Operations

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use and enable the Subgroups operations feature.

## GLSL Shaders

In shader enable `GL_KHR_shader_subgroup_basic` extension.
TODO: add more description

## Enabling the Feature

To enable the subgroups feature in the Vulkan API you must create a Vulkan instance with a minimum version of version 1.1. Enable the extension `VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control` and get the subgroup properties of a physical device

```C++
VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupProperties subgroups_properties;
subgroups_properties.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SUBGROUP_PROPERTIES;
subgroups_properties.pNext = VK_NULL_HANDLE;

VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 device_properties2 = {};
device_properties2.sType                       = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2;
device_properties2.pNext                       = &subgroups_properties;
vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2(gpu.get_handle(), &device_properties2);
```
