# Color write enable
## Overview
This sample demonstrates how to use `VK_EXT_color_write_enable` extension. This extension allows toggle the output color attachments using a pipeline dynamic state. It allows the program to prepare an additional framebuffer populated with the data from a defined color blend attachment which can be blended dynamically to the final scene.

The final results are comparable to those obtained with `vkCmdSetColorWriteMaskEXT`, but it does not require the GPU driver to support `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3`.

## How to use in Vulkan
Program needs to enable extension `VK_EXT_COLOR_WRITE_ENABLE_EXTENSION_NAME` and request feature `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_COLOR_WRITE_ENABLE_FEATURES_EXT`. 
`VkPipelineColorWriteCreateInfoEXT` contains an array of Boolean values that serve as toggles for the corresponding `VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState`. This array can be overwritten dynamically with the `vkCmdSetColorWriteEnableEXT function`. 

Adding multiple color blend attachments requires the addition of the corresponding color attachments in the render subpass. Each additional render subpass attachment requires an  extra framebuffer. These framebuffers are filled with data separately in the fragment shader.

## The sample
The sample shows how to setup an application to work with this extension:
- How to enable the extension.
- How to set up multiple color attachments in the color blend state.
- How to set up the render subpass and framebuffers for multiple color attachments.
- How to write a fragment shader with multiple outputs.

Three attachments have been prepared - each with a separate channel from RGB. Checkboxes are used to toggle the `vkCmdSetColorWriteEnableEXT` function disabling each attachment. As a result of its disabling, the value of a given channel is set as the value of that channel in the background color.

## Known issues
Validation layers show a mismatch error in the number of attachments between the subpass (3 attachments) and color blend state (1 attachment). The error is generated by the UI, which expects one attachment in the subpass.
