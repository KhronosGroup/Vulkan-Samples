### Push Descriptors<br/>
**Extension**: [```VK_KHR_push_descriptor```](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_KHR_push_descriptor)<br/>
Push descriptors apply the push constants concept to descriptor sets. Instead of creating per-object descriptor sets, this example passes descriptors at command buffer creation time.
