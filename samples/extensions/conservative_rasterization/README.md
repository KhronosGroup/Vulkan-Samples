### Conservative Rasterization]<br/>
**Extension**: [```VK_EXT_conservative_rasterization```](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_EXT_conservative_rasterization)<br/>
Uses conservative rasterization to change the way fragments are generated. Enables overestimation to generate fragments for every pixel touched instead of only pixels that are fully covered.
