# Basic HLSL hardware accelerated ray tracing<br/>

## Overview

This sample is based on raytracing_basic sample. The only difference is using precompiled HLSL shaders instead of GLSL shaders

## HLSL shaders

HLSL shaders can be compiled by Microsoftâ€™s DirectX shader compiler (DXC). For compiling raytracing shaders above commend can be used:
dxc.exe -fspv-target-env=vulkan1.1spirv1.4 -spirv -T lib_6_3 <path_to_raytracing_shader> -Fo <output_path>
