### Fragment shading rate<br/>
**Extension**: [```VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate```](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate.html)<br/>
Uses a special framebuffer attachment to control fragment shading rates for different framebuffer regions. This allows explicit control over the number of fragment shader invocations for each pixel covered by a fragment, which is e.g. useful for foveated rendering.
