// Extended dynamic_state3: Rasterization samples


== Overview

This sample demonstrates one of the functionalities of VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 related to rasterization samples.
The extension can be used to dynamically change sampling without need to swap pipelines.

== Enabling the extension

To be able to use this extension in Vulkan API:
`VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3` depends on `VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2`, which is promoted to Vulkan 1.1. That is, to use this extension, `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3` and either `VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2` or Vulkan 1.1+ are required.

== Using the extension

To use the extension:
1) `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_RASTERIZATION_SAMPLES_EXT` must be added to `VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo`.
2) Method `void vkCmdSetRasterizationSamplesEXT(VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkSampleCountFlagBits rasterizationSamples)` should be called inside active command buffer.

== Known issues

The extension always reports the following validation errors when enabled:
....
SYNC-HAZARD-WRITE-AFTER-READ: Validation Error: [ SYNC-HAZARD-WRITE-AFTER-READ ] Object 0: handle = 0x555556f0b520, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_QUEUE; | MessageID = 0x376bc9df | vkQueueSubmit():  Hazard WRITE_AFTER_READ for entry 0, VkCommandBuffer 0x555558e50aa0[], Submitted access info (submitted_usage: SYNC_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSITION, command: vkCmdPipelineBarrier, seq_no: 1, VkImage 0xcb3ee80000000007[], reset_no: 6).
