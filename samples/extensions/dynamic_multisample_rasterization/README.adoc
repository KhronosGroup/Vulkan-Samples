// Extended dynamic_state3: Rasterization samples


== Overview

This sample demonstrates one of the functionalities of VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 related to rasterization samples.
The extension can be used to dynamically change sampling without need to swap pipelines.

== Enabling the extension

To be able to use this extension in Vulkan API:
`VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3` depends on `VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2`, which is promoted to Vulkan 1.1. That is, to use this extension, `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3` and either `VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2` or Vulkan 1.1 are required.
Additionally this sample uses `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering" which required Vulkan 1.2.

== Using the extension

To use the extension:
1) `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_RASTERIZATION_SAMPLES_EXT` must be added to `VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo`.
2) Method `void vkCmdSetRasterizationSamplesEXT(VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer, VkSampleCountFlagBits rasterizationSamples)` should be called with the active command buffer.
