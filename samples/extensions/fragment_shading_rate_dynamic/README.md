### Fragment shading rate_dynamic<br/>
**Extension**: [```VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate```](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate.html) <br/>
Render a simple scene showing the basics of shading rate dynamic.  This sample shows low and high frequency textures 
over several cubes.  It creates a sample rate map based upon this frequency every frame. Then it uses that dynamic 
sample rate map as a base for the next frame.
