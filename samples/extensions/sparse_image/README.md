<!-- NOTE: Remove the following comment block for the actual readme of your sample -->

<!--
This is a template for the sample's readme. Every new sample should come with a readme that contains at least a short tutorial that accompanies the code of the example.

Readmes are written in Markdown (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

You can freely choose how to structure it, but it should always contain an overview and conclusion paragraph.

The readme can (and most often should) show code from along with an explanation. Code in markdown can be rendered using three backticks and can be formatted using a language specifier, e.g.:

```cpp
void main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World";
}
```

or

```glsl
void main() {
    gl_color = vec4(1.0f);
}
```

Ideally it also contains an image of how the sample is supposed to look.

For an example you can take a look at the readme's of existing samples, e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan-Samples/main/samples/extensions/descriptor_indexing/README.md
-->

# Overview

<!-- 
This chapter should contain an overview of what this sample is trying to achieve. If extensions are used, this chapter should also list those.
-->

<!-- 
The following chapters get into the details on how the sample is working, what features are used, etc. 

The chapter itself can be structured by using sub paragraphs, e.g.:

# Feature description

# Enabling extensions

# etc.

-->

# Conclusion

<!--
The tutorial should end with a conclusion chapter that recaps the tutorial and (if applicable) talks about pros and cons of the features demonstrated in this sample
