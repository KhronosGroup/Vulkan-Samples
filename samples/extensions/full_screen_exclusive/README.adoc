= Full Screen Exclusive

== Overview

This code sample demonstrates how to incorporate the Vulkan extension `VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive`.
This extension provides a solution for the full screen exclusion issue on Windows prior to the 11 version.
Windows prior to 11 cannot correctly get an exclusive full screen window, `VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive` is applicable on Windows prior to  version 11 platform alone.

== Introduction

This sample provides a detailed procedure to activate full screen exclusive mode on Windows applications.
Users can switch display modes from: 1) windowed, 2) borderless fullscreen, and 3) exclusive fullscreen using keyboard inputs.

== *Reminder

Configuring the `swapchain create info` using full screen exclusive extension *DOES NOT* automatically set the application window to full screen mode.
The following procedure shows how to activate full screen exclusive mode correctly:

1) recreate the `swapchain` using `full screen exclusive`.
2) recreate the `frame buffers` with the new `swapchain`.
3) configure the application window to *fullscreen mode* 4) execute the `acquire full screen exclusive EXT` call.
