== Renaming Default Branch

We have recently transitioned the repository to use the `main` branch by default.
All remote git usage is handled automatically.
To update your local repository to use main please use the following commands

----
git branch -m master main && git fetch origin && git branch -u origin/main main && git remote set-head origin -a
----
endif::[]

== Introduction

The Vulkan Samples is collection of resources to help you develop optimized Vulkan applications.

If you are new to Vulkan the xref:samples/api/README.adoc[API samples] are the right place to start.
Additionally you may find the following links useful:

ifdef::site-gen-antora[]
* xref:guide:ROOT:index.adoc[Vulkan Guide]
* xref:tutorial:ROOT:00_Introduction.adoc[Get Started in Vulkan]
endif::[]

ifndef::site-gen-antora[]
* https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Guide[Vulkan Guide]
* https://vulkan-tutorial.com/[Get Started in Vulkan]
endif::[]

xref:samples/performance/README.adoc[Performance samples] show the recommended best practice together with real-time profiling information.
They are more advanced but also contain a detailed tutorial with more in-detail explanations.

=== Goals

* Create a collection of resources that demonstrate best-practice recommendations in Vulkan
* Create tutorials that explain the implementation of best-practices and include performance analysis guides
* Create a xref:framework/README.adoc[framework] that can be used as reference material and also as a sandbox for advanced experimentation with Vulkan

== Samples

* xref:./samples/README.adoc[Listing of all samples available in this repository]

== General information

* *Project Basics*
 ** xref:./docs/misc.adoc#controls[Controls]
 ** xref:./docs/misc.adoc#debug-window[Debug window]
 ** xref:./scripts/README.adoc[Create a Sample]
* *Vulkan Essentials*
 ** xref:./samples/vulkan_basics.adoc[How does Vulkan compare to OpenGL ES?
What should you expect when targeting Vulkan?]
* *Misc*
 ** xref:./docs/misc.adoc#driver-version[Driver version]
 ** xref:./docs/memory_limits.adoc[Memory limits]

== Setup

Prerequisites: https://git-scm.com/downloads[git] with https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage[git large file storage (git-lfs)].

Clone the repo with submodules using the following command:

----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples.git
cd Vulkan-Samples
----

Follow build instructions for your platform below.

== Build

=== Supported Platforms

* Windows - xref:./docs/build.adoc#windows[Build Guide]
* Linux - xref:./docs/build.adoc#linux[Build Guide]
* macOS - xref:./docs/build.adoc#macos[Build Guide]
* Android - xref:./docs/build.adoc#android[Build Guide]

== Usage

The following shows some example command line usage on how to configure and run the Vulkan Samples.

> Make sure that you are running the samples from the root directory of the repository.
> Otherwise the samples will not be able to find the assets.
> ./build/app/bin/<BuildType>/<Arch>/vulkan_samples

----
# For the entire usage use
vulkan_samples --help

# For subcommand usage use
vulkan_samples <sub_command> --help

# Run Swapchain Images sample
vulkan_samples sample swapchain_images

# Run AFBC sample in benchmark mode for 5000 frames
vulkan_samples sample afbc --benchmark --stop-after-frame 5000

# Run bonza test offscreen
vulkan_samples test bonza --headless

# Run all the performance samples for 10 seconds in each configuration
vulkan_samples batch --category performance --duration 10

# Run Swapchain Images sample on an Android device
adb shell am start-activity -n com.khronos.vulkan_samples/com.khronos.vulkan_samples.SampleLauncherActivity -e sample swapchain_images
