== Quality Assurance

We use a small set of tools to provide a level of quality to the project.
These tools are part of our CI/CD process.
If your local environment does not have the same versions of the tools we use in the CI you may see some errors or warnings pop-up when pushing.

For up-to date version information please see the repositories for the individual tools

* Doxygen https://github.com/KhronosGroupActions/doxygen[Doxygen Repository]
* Clang Format / Clang Tidy https://github.com/KhronosGroupActions/clang-tools[Clang Tools Repository]
* Snake Case Check https://github.com/KhronosGroupActions/snake-case-check[Snake Case Check Repository]
* Android NDK https://github.com/KhronosGroupActions/android-ndk-build[Android NDK Repository]

== 3D models

Most of the samples require 3D models downloaded from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples-Assets.
That repository is referenced as a git submodule by this project so if you followed the clone instructions in the xref:../README.adoc[project readme] you will already have the models locally under `./assets/`.

On Android, Gradle will run CMake which will sync assets to the device if there has been a change.

However, to sync them manually you may run the following command to ensure up to date assets are on the device:

----
adb push --sync assets /sdcard/Android/data/com.khronos.vulkan_samples/files/
adb push --sync shaders /sdcard/Android/data/com.khronos.vulkan_samples/files/
----

== Performance data

In order for performance data to be displayed, profiling needs to be enabled on the device.
Some devices may disable it by default.

Profiling can be enabled via adb:

----
adb shell setprop security.perf_harden 0
----

____
Performance data is captured using HWCPipe.
For details on this project and how to integrate it in your pipeline, visit: https://github.com/ARM-software/HWCPipe
____

== Windows

=== Dependencies

* CMake v3.12+
* Python 3
* Visual Studio 2017 or above

It's recommended to open the XCode project that is generated inside build/mac; building can be handled with command-B.

`Step 3.` Run the *Vulkan Samples* application

To run Vulkan Samples, one must have an iOS device provisioned and working with XCode.  Open the XCode project and ensure that can build/install to a device through XCode normally.
Once the bundle is created from the build command in Step 2, use the edit-scheme selection in XCode and set the arguments to have --help
Click the "Play" button and you should see the help output in the terminal.
For convenience, the default setting is to run the hello_triangle sample; just edit that to your desired sample to run

== Android

=== Dependencies

For all dependencies set the following environment variables:

* JDK 8+ `JAVA_HOME=<SYSTEM_DIR>/java`
* Android SDK `ANDROID_HOME=<WORK_DIR>/android-sdk`
* CMake v3.16+
* Android NDK r23+ `ANDROID_NDK_HOME=<WORK_DIR>/android-ndk`
* <<cmake-options,CMake Options>>
* <<3d-models,3D models>>
* <<performance-data,Performance data>>

____
We use this environment in the CI https://github.com/KhronosGroupActions/android-ndk-build[Android NDK Repository]
____

It is highly recommended to install https://d.android.com/studio[Android Studio] to build, run and trace the sample project.
Android Studio uses the following plugins/tools to build samples:

* Android Gradle Plugin
* CMake Plugin, which installs and uses Ninja
* NDK

Their versions are configured in the https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/blob/main/bldsys/cmake/template/gradle/build.gradle.in[build.gradle.in] and https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/blob/main/bldsys/cmake/template/gradle/app.build.gradle.in[app.build.gradle.in files];
when updating these versions, refer to https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk#default-ndk-per-agp[the official documentation for the recommended combinations].

=== Build with Gradle

==== Generate the gradle project

To generate the gradle project, run the following command:

----
./scripts/generate.py android
----

A new folder will be created in the root directory at `build\android_gradle`

==== Install dependencies

https://d.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api[Android Gradle Plugin] (used by Android Studio) may not auto install dependencies.
You will need to install them if they have not been installed:

* Find the configured versions in `build/android_gradle/app/build.gradle`, or its template file https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/blob/main/bldsys/cmake/template/gradle/app.build.gradle.in[`bldsys/cmake/template/gradle/app.build.gradle.in`]
* https://d.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk[Install them with Android Studio] or https://d.android.com/studio/projects/configure-agp-ndk?language=agp4-1#command-line[sdkmanager command line tool].
For example, to install AGP port CMake 3.22.1 and NDK version 25.1.8937393 on Linux, do the following:
+
----
 yes | ${your-sdk}/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
 ${your-sdk}/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --install "ndk;25.1.8937393" --channel=3
 ${your-sdk}/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --install "cmake;3.22.1" --channel=3
----

==== Build the project

----
cd build/android_gradle
----

____
Prefer a release build for better performance unless you want to actively debug the application.
____

For a release build:

----
gradle assembleRelease
----

For a debug build:

----
gradle assembleDebug
----

==== Install the apk on the device

You can now install the apk on a connected device using the Android Debug Bridge:

For a release build:

----
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/vulkan_samples-release.apk
----

For a debug build:

----
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/vulkan_samples-debug.apk
----

=== Build with Android Studio

With https://d.android.com/studio[Android Studio] you can open the `build/android_gradle/build.gradle` project, compile and run the project from here.
The lastest Android Studio release is recommended.

If you have agreed with the licenses previously on your development system, Android Studio will automatically install, at the start up time, CMake and NDK with the version configured in your `build/android-gradle/build.gradle`.
Otherwise (or if the installation failed), you need to install the required CMake and NDK manually, refer to https://d.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk[the official instructions] for the detailed steps.
The default installed locations are:

* $SDK-ROOT-DIR/ndk/$ndkVersion for NDK.
* $SDK-ROOT-DIR/cmake/$cmake-version for CMake.

Android Studio will use the above default locations without any environment variable requirement;
if you want to use the same NDK and CMake versions for other purpose, you can simply configure your environment variables to these locations.
If you do set up the NDK and CMake environment variables, Android Studio will use them instead of the default locations.
